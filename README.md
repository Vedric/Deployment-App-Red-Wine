Block 5 - Industrialisation of a machine learning algorithm and automation of decision processes

 C5.1 - Standardise the construction and computing environment of a machine learning algorithm using production tools such as MLflow and Docker to facilitate the production of artificial intelligence projects on all types of platforms.

C5.2 - Create an application programming interface using tools such as AWS sagemaker to give all relevant business teams access to machine learning algorithm predictions at scale 

 C5.3 - Deploy a web application integrating predictive statistics algorithms (Machine Learning and Deep Learning) using tools such as Flask, Heroku or AWS sagemaker to make them usable by all business teams in order to automate their decision-making processes
